# Web Scraping Libraries Research

What I found
LXML
	• Fast at scraping large documents
	• Well documented
	• Easy file manipulation
	• Has a soupparser so you can use beautiful soup’s functionality if needed
  
Scrappy
	• Open source framework
	• CPU and memory efficient
	• Best for big scale web scraping
	• Well structured → more flexible and adaptable
	• Dont use if use scraping a few webpages, will over complicate things

Beautiful Soup
	• Good for beginners
	• Best to use if documents are not structured
	• Not good for big for big projects because not flexible and hard to maintain as project size increases

Requests
	• Good for starting out
	• Simple and dont need alot of practice
	• Very well written documentation
	• Dont use if webpage jas JS content → wont parse the correct information
Beautiful Soup can only parse data and not request so normally used along side the Requests library

Urlib
	• Offers functionality to deal with and open URL’s
	• Bit more complicated that Request but you get more control 

Selenium
	• Good for beginners but also powerful
	• Good for a few webpages and the information you need is in JS 
  • High CPU usage not good for big projects

How this can be used in the context of the project
Overall I think that the top three web scraping libraries we could use would be 1. LXML 2. Scrappy 3. Beautiful Soup/Requests. LXML is fast at scraping 
large documents which I think can be useful since we might be scraping various websites. It also has a soupparser so we can use Beautiful Soup's functionality
if needed. Scrappy is also good for big scale webscraping and is memory efficient. Beautiful Soup/Requests is good for beginners and might be easier for us to learn.
